### Projectile Motion
- Motion of an object thrown at an angle with  ==Horizontal & Vertical== Motion.
	- This forms a parabolic or curved path.
- Has 3 types:
	- Horizontal
	- Vertical
	- Level Ground

#### What are the components in projectile motion?

<span class='centerImg'> ![[009 RangeHieght.svg | 400]]  </span>

1. **Range ($dx$) **
	- This is the distance from the firing point to the impact point.

2. **Hieght ($dy$)**
	- This is the hieght of the projectile. In the following notes, the hieght will depend.
		- **Horizontal  = $dy$ is not needed since the launching position is the height of the projectile**
		- **Level Ground & Vertical = $dy$ is the tip of the projectile's path.**
	
3. **Y-Component ($Vfy, Viy$)**
	- This is the Y component of the projectile. 
	-  ==**Gravity is acting force on this**==, So this always changes.

4. **X-Component ($Vfx, Vix$) **
	- This is the X component of the projectile.
	- ==**There is no force acting on this**==, so this remains constant. 
		- This is disregarding Air Resistance, So thats why it remains constant.
		- This means that $Vix = Vfx$

5. Velocity **($Vf$ , $Vi$)**
	- There are 2 Velocities since there are 2 sides of projectile motion. This would be important for Vertical or 
		- The first one (Pink), is from the starting point to the tip of the apex.
		- The second one (Orange), is from the tip to the ending point.
	- Final Velocity, $Vf$
	- Initial Velocity, $Vi$

- *$dx$'s Formula is practically interchangable.^*

###  Horizontal Projectile Motion
- Launced at a hieght with no angle.
	- This means that only one part of the arc is used.
	- That also means that there is only one Vf and Vi.

- If you noticed, This is the other half of the whole arc. From the peak to the landing point.

##### Word problem #1
-  There is only one VF and VI here, since this is only one side of the projectile motion. We started from the apex and going down.

- Vfy is the final velocity since it is the one thats only changing.
- Viy is 0 since the y component hasnt been moved yet by gravity (Not falling yet)
	- This is only for horizontally launched projectiles.

##### Word problem #2
- For this side note, $vi = Vix, Vfx$  refer to the X component.
