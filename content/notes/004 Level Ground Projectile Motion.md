### What is Level Ground Projectile Motion
- Unlike [[004 Projectile Motion and Horizontal Motion | Horizontal Projectile Motion]], ==It has an angle now,==and the projectile is ==launched at the ground== .

- This time, Unlike [[004 Projectile Motion and Horizontal Motion#Horizontal Projectile Motion|Horizontal Projectile Motion]] we are now using the entire parabolic path.
- Since this is now the entire parabolic path, We can use [[003 Free Fall#^0a2358 | Freefall's Time Symmetry.]]]
##### Problem #1
- Now since it is launched at the ground, The hieght is the apex of the projectile. For the horizontal one, we are already at the hieght of the projectile.

 - For $t(up)$, We are solving for the bottom to the apex. Then we can apply time symmetry to get the total side
