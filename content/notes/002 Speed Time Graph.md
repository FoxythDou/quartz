### Speed Time Graph
- **Shows Acceleration**
	- m/s<sup>2</sup>
- Like the Previous graph, It has the same slope formula **but...** *with Distance swapped by velocity.*
- With 5 types 2.

```ad-form
$$slope = \frac {rise}{run} = \frac {y}{x} = \frac {y^2-y^1}{x^2-x^1}$$

**Where:**
- $x$ is *Time*
- $y$ is *Velocity*

The slope's measure is in m/s.
```

```ad-note
Remember that the result is now **ACCELERATION** & not velocity.
```

### 1st Graph: Constant (+)


<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211018084353.png | 550]]</span>


- The graph shows that...
	- Constant acceleration (+)
	- Increasing Velocity, Constant interval (+)
	- Increasing Displacement (+)
- Getting faster and faster constantly.

```ad-note 
 **Difference**

```

### 2nd Graph: Constant (-)

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211018084915.png|550]]</span>

- This graph shows that
	- Constant acceleration (-)
	- Decreasing Velocity, Constant interval (-)
	- Increasing Displacement (+)
-  The object is moving forward, But gets slower. (Doesnt Stop)

```



### 3rd Graph: Not accelerating, But moving


<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211018085623.png | 550]]  </span>

- This graph shows us that...
	- Zero acceleration 
	- Constant velocity (+)
	- Increasing Displacement (+)
- The object **is moving but not accelerating.** 

```ad-note
**Differences:**

```

### 4th Graph: Increasing Velocity and Interval

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211018090051.png|550]]</span>


- The graph shows us that...
	- Increasing Acceleration(+)
	- Increasing Velocity, Increasing Interval
	- Increasing Displacement (+)
- Car is moving forward, Going faster at an increasing interval.

```ad-note
**Differences:**

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211105205041.png|300]]  </span>

- Practically the same **BUT:**
	- Velocity Graph is increasing speed with an increasing interval.
	- Displacement Graph is just increasing speed.

*(Not entirely 100% sure here, so take it as a grain of salt)*

```

### 5th Graph: Increasing Velocity, Decreasing Interval


<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211018090437.png|550]]</span>



- The graph shows that...
	- Decreasing Acceleration (+, Basically its accelerating but the rate is decreasing)
	- Increasing both velocity and displacement (+)
- The object is speeding to a constant speed.

```ad-note
**Differences:**


<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211105205748.png|330]]</span>


- The Velocity-Time Graph is:
	- Decelerating to a constant speed
	- Moving
- The Displacement-Time Graph is:
	- About to slow down and stop
```

### How to solve for Distance
1. Use the formula: **$d = \big ( \frac {vf+vi}{2} \big ) t$**
	- Substitute $vf$ as the last point, and $vi$ as the first point at the x-axis.
	-  $t$ is the time at the y-axis

2. Ok no dont actually use the area formula with shapes and stuff it'll kill u
