### Freefall
- Gravity Pulling on the object.
	- In Earth, The rate of gravity is  -9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>

> **Not encountering significant force of air resistance; They are falling under the sole influence of gravity. **

- Remember that there is Time and Speed symmetry. ^fe8813
	- When the green side takes 2 seconds to go up, It takes the orange side 2 seconds to go down too. ^0a2358
	- Same goes with speed.

#### What are the factors of the objects rate of fall?
- **Surface area**
	- By having bigger surface area, More air particles hit the object thus slowing it down. Thus air resistance.

```ad-note
**Why is aristotle wrong regarding mass and its relation to an objects rate of fall?**

It's because the ==*mass hasn't changed*== when we crumpled paper. What did change is the surface area of the paper.

Put simply:
- Uncrumpled paper = Flatter surface = More air resistance = Slower
- Crumpled paper = Smaller surface = Less air hitting it = Faster 

```

### Free fall Formulas
```ad-form
- **Gravity formulae **
 $$\overrightarrow {g} = \frac {Vf - Vi}{t}$$ 
$$\overrightarrow {g} = \frac {Vf^2 - Vi^2}{2d}$$

- **Distance Formulae**
$$\overrightarrow {d} = \frac {Vf^2 - Vi^2}{2g}$$
$$\overrightarrow {d} = Vit+ \frac {gt^2}{2}$$  
```

### Sign Conventions
- **Distance above the origin **
	- (+) In meter unit
- **Distance below the origin**
	- (-) in meter unit
- **Upward velocities**
	- (+) in m/s unit
- **Downward velocties**
	-  (-) in m/s unit
- **Gravity (g)**
	- ==**ALWAYS -9.8 m/s^2 **== 


### Solving 

A boy tosses a coin upward with a velocity of 14.7 m/s. 
- Find the maximum hieght reached
- Time of flight
- Velocity of the coin when it returns to the hand.
- With what velocity if he fails to catch the coin. The boy's had is 0.48 m above the ground

**Given**
- $Vi = 14.7 m/s$ 
- $g = -9.8 m/s^2$
- The boys hand is 0.48 m above the ground.

**Asked**
- $d = ?$
- $t = ?$
- $vf = ?$ (For the other side)
- $vf = ?$ (If boy didn't catch it)

**Solution**
- $d = 11.03 m$

- $t = 3$

```ad-note
Remember that we are finding the ==total flight time== of the coin. Using [[003 Free Fall#^fe8813 | Speed and time symmetry.]] So it's doubled.
```
- $vf = -14.70 m/s$ 
![[Pasted image 20211025090918.png|500]]
- $vf = -15.03 m/s$ if the boy didn't catch it.

- Second way, But with 15.02 as the difference only.

### Terminal Velocity
- The moment when the sky diver is already getting a constant velocity. Not accelerating anymore just stable.
- We accelerate up until Air resistance = Force of gravity.
