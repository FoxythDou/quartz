### Displacement time graph
- The displacement of a moving object changes with time.
- **Finding for the Speed or Velocity **of an object.
```ad-form
$$slope = \frac {rise}{run} = \frac {y}{x} = \frac {y^2-y^1}{x^2-x^1}$$

**Where:**
- $x$ is *time*
- $y$ is *displacement*

The slope's measure is in m/s.
```
- Has 5 types with varying velocity.

### Constant (+)

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011082654.png | 550]]</span>
- As you can see, its just constant speed. 1.67 m/s throughout the way.
- This graph tells us that...
	- Constant speed (+)
	- Increasing displacement
	- Zero Acceleration
- Its moving away from the origin at a constant speed.

### Constant (-)

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011083534.png | 550]]  </span>

- This graph tells us that...
	- Constant Speed (-)
	- Decreasing Displacement
	- Zero Acceleration
- Moving back to the origin at a constant speed.

### At Rest

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011084116.png |520]]  </span>

- This graph tells us that ...
	- No speed
	- No Displacement travelled
	- Zero Acceleration
- The object is at rest 
```ad-note

- This wont work, Since this means that the time is stopped. (Remember that time is the x axis.)

```

### Velocity (+)

<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011085153.png | 550]] </span>


- This graph tells us that...
	- Increasing speed
	- Increasing displacement
	- Accelerating 
- Moving forward away at an increasing speed. 

### Velocity (-)


<span class='centerImg'> ![[Pasted image 20211011085921.png | 550]]  </span>

- This graph tells us that...
	- Decreasing speed
	- Increasing Displacement
	- Acceleration (-, Decelerating) 
- Moving forward at a decreasing speed.

```ad-note
- Increasing displacement, But the interval is decreasing.
- Basically, Cars moving (Displacement) but its velocity is slowing.
